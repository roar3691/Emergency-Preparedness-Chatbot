# Emergency Preparedness Chatbot

This is an AI-powered chatbot designed to provide emergency preparedness advice. The chatbot is fine-tuned on a GPT-2 model and can answer questions related to emergency preparedness. It uses **Streamlit** for the user interface and **Hugging Face's Transformers** library for text generation.

## Features

- Provides intelligent responses to questions about emergency preparedness.
- Maintains conversation history to provide context-aware responses.
- Fine-tuned on a custom dataset using GPT-2.
- Efficiently handles large files using Git LFS (Large File Storage).
- Deployed using Streamlit for an interactive web-based interface.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

1. **Python 3.8+**: Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. **Git**: Make sure Git is installed for version control.
3. **Git LFS**: Install Git Large File Storage (LFS) to manage large files like model checkpoints.

   - Install Git LFS:
     ```bash
     brew install git-lfs
     ```

4. **Streamlit**: Install Streamlit for the web-based interface.
5. **Hugging Face Transformers**: Install the Transformers library for GPT-2 model.

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/emergency_chatbot.git
cd emergency_chatbot
```

### Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or manually install the key dependencies:

```bash
pip install streamlit transformers torch accelerate pdfplumber git-lfs
```

### Set Up Git LFS

Make sure Git LFS is set up to handle large files like model checkpoints:

```bash
git lfs install
git lfs track "*.bin" "*.zip" "*.tar" "*.mp4" "*.jpg" "*.png"
```

## Usage

### Fine-Tuning the GPT-2 Model

If you want to fine-tune the GPT-2 model on your own dataset, you can use the `finetune_gpt2.py` script:

```bash
python finetune_gpt2.py
```

This will fine-tune the GPT-2 model on your dataset and save the model and tokenizer in the `gpt2-finetuned-emergency/checkpoint-18` directory.

### Running the Chatbot Application

To run the chatbot application using Streamlit, use the following command:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This will start a local server, and you can interact with the chatbot via your web browser at `http://localhost:8501`.
